# Noted.js

Noted is a twist on the familiar Stickies app in your browser, repurposed for to-do lists.

- Create notes and add items, which you can check off as you go.
- Add due dates to items to keep track of what needs doing, and get reminders when deadlines are approaching or have passed.
- Double-click items or note titles to edit them.
- Drag and drop notes to sort them.
- Resize notes by dragging from the bottom right corner.
- Drag and drop items, too, within a note, or even between notes.
- Change note colors and more with the note tools menu.
- Choose between a few different background textures.

Noted uses HTML5 local storage to record your data — **your information is never sent to any server**. That means it’s fast and totally private. But it also means there’s no syncing, and your notes are only available on the specific computer, using the specific browser used to create them.

To give you something to work with, you can export Noted data as JSON (a lightweight, open data format), which you can re-import in another browser or on another computer.
